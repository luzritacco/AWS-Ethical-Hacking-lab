As part of my learning experience at TKH, we Have to working-team where participants can simulate real-world scenarios, fostering collaboration and problem-solving skills. The lab provides an opportunity to work with AWS's native security services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Shield, and AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall). Our team aspires to create a website that showcases our home lab and documents our process of establishing it in the cloud.

 My paper provides a comprehensive overview of the tools and services that I use in my security home lab. I describe the functionality, purpose, and relevance of each tool and service in the context of the security industry.I also demonstrate how I can apply them to real world scenarios and challenges that security professionals face. My paper intends to showcase my skills and knowledge in security testing, analysis, and research.
